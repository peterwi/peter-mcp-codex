Create a pull request: commit all changes, push to remote, and raise a GitHub PR. This is a complete workflow for submitting work for review.

Steps:
1. Check git status and show what's being committed
2. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
3. Create commit with descriptive message
4. Push to origin (create feature branch if needed)
5. Create PR using gh pr create with title and body
6. Display PR URL for easy access

Use this command when you have completed a feature or fix and want to submit it for code review.
